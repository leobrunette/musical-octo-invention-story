Under the ocean, many creatures often miss the opertunity to hear beautiful music because no technology exists to reproduce music under water.
Many ocean creatures have attempted to create new technology that allows them to listen to their precious music on repeat. This wasn't until octo the octopus was born, and a new generation of music was discovered.

Octo invents a technology to allow sound propagation under water. He could spray a special liquid to solidify the water temporarily. The solid item then becomes a medium to connect the audience and player allowing for the transmit of sound wave.

One day an octopus named Squidward invited another octupus whose name is Patrick
to listen to his music. The rhyhm was attractive and Patrick even lost himself in
the music. Soon Squidward and Patrick became friends. 

Squidward is thinking of becoming a rockstar. In fact, the first rockstar in the history of the seven seas.
Squidward can play the water drums, water bass, and water guitar (all simultaneously because he has 8 arms), but he
lacks confidence in his vocal capabilities. Squidward invites Patrick to become his vocalist. Together,
they form the band Octopus Garden. Octopus Garden immediately made a hit as they were the only musical band in the
ocean. Soon, Squidward and Patrick find themselves touring the seven seas in their Yellow Submarine.
